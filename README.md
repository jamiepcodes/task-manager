# task-manager
A quick and barebones task manager app, further implementation incoming.
The majority of this project was filled up with me rather frustratingly having to troubleshoot issues that ~3 years ago, I knew like the back of my hand.
However, all things considered, although the front end is needing a lot more work, there are areas of the back end logic and data handling that I am proud of, as well as parts that I didn't think I'd be able to complete or figure out. So there's progress there and something to build upon. Which is something I look forward to in the future.

Thank you,
Jamie
